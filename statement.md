# Problem Statement
Restaurants and small food outlets often struggle with manual order-taking and billing, which can lead to calculation mistakes, lost records, and slow service.
Without a digital system, maintaining menu items, managing orders, and securely storing billing history becomes inefficient.
A simple, reliable, and beginner-friendly console-based solution is required to automate billing, maintain accuracy, and store transaction logs safely.

# Scope of the Project
- Develop a console-based restaurant billing system using Python.
- Store and manage menu items using a JSON file.
- Allow users to start new orders and add menu items with quantities.
- Generate bills with subtotal, tax, and total amount.
- Automatically store order history in a log file for future reference.
- Keep the system simple for beginners learning Python file handling and basic billing logic.
